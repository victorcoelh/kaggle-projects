# Iris Dataset

In this repository, I perform Exploratory Data Analysis and create a Machine Learning model
for the [Iris Dataset](). My model of choice was a Logistic Regression model, a simple solution
for a relatively simple and well studied dataset.

### Running the Notebooks locally
An installation of Python version 3.12 or above is required to run the notebooks.

First, install the requirements with pip:
```pip install -r ./iris/requirements.txt```

Then, use your favorite IDE or JupyterLab to open, edit and execute the .ipynb files.
