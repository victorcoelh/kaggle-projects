# Kaggle Projects

![An Image from the Iris Dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-datasets-images/19/19/default-backgrounds/dataset-card.jpg)

A repository containing solutions for a plethora of Kaggle challenges and datasets, as well as some other common
training datasets in the Machine Learning domain. I mainly use this repository to help understand Machine Learning
concepts, and as practice.

So far, I've attempted to solve the following challenges:
- [Iris Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris)
- [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
- [UCI Wine Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/109/wine)
- [NLP with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started)

### Usage

Each directory inside this repository is a different challenge, and the documentation and environment
necessary to understand and run each solution is bundled with the solutions themselves.
