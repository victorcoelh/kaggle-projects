# UCI Wine Dataset Analysis and Model

In this repository, I perform Exploratory Data Analysis and create two Machine Learning models
for the [UCI Wine Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/109/wine). My reasoning for
each decision is documented inside the Jupyter Notebooks, alongside the code, as well as my
analysis of the results.

Logistic Regression and Random Forest were my models of choice for this particular dataset.

### Running the Notebooks locally
An installation of Python version 3.12 or above is required to run the notebooks.

First, install the requirements with pip:
```pip install -r ./wine/requirements.txt```

Then, use your favorite IDE or JupyterLab to open, edit and execute the .ipynb files.
